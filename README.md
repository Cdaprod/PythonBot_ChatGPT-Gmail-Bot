# README.md

This Python script leverages the power of OpenAI's ChatGPT3 to scan emails through the Gmail API, seeking out job offers, and subsequently provides notifications via the Slack API.

Please note that this script is a proof of concept and not yet ready for a production environment. It currently lacks the integration of environment variables for elements such as API keys, tokens, and credentials.

While this proof of concept is not intended to be used directly as is, it serves to outline the fundamental operations of the underlying bot. However, it's close to completion, with areas still requiring refinement including error handling, logging, and the incorporation of environment variables. 

If you are interested in using this repository, we recommend forking your own version. If you plan on developing it further, this will add an additional layer of security when it comes time to publish your own version.
